= How to use the LCAClassifier =

== Classification algorithm ==

Taxonomical classification starts with alignment to a reference sequence database (such as SilvaMod or Greengenes) using the NCBI blastall implementation of Megablast. The LCAClassifier requires that output is saved in XML format. The classification is then carried out based on a subset of the best matching alignments using the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)] of this subset. Briefly, the subset includes sequences that score within x% of the “bit-score” of the best alignment, providing the best score is above a minimum value. Default values for the minimum bit-score is 155 and for the LCA range (x) 2%. Based on cross-validation testing using the non-redundant SilvaMod database, this results in relatively few false positives for most datasets. However, the LCA range can be increased up to about 10% (using the -r option), to increase accuracy with short reads and for datasets with many novel sequences.

In addition to LCA classification, a minimum similarity filter is used, based on a set of rank-specific requirements. Firstly, a sequence must be aligned with at least 99% nucleotide similarity to the best reference sequence in order to be classified to the species rank. For the genus, family, order, class and phylum ranks the respective cut-offs are 97%, 95%, 90%, 85% and 80%. This filter ensures that classification is made to the taxon of the lowest allowed rank, effectively re-assigning sequences to parent taxa until allowed. 

== Preparing sequences ==

For amplicon sequences, we strongly recommend noise reduction (using e.g [http://code.google.com/p/ampliconnoise Ampliconnoise], 
[http://qiime.org/tutorials/denoising_454_data.html Denoiser], or [http://vamps.mbl.edu/resources/software.php SLP] as well as
chimera removal (using e.g. [http://code.google.com/p/ampliconnoise Perseus] or [http://drive5.com/uchime/ UCHIME] prior to submission. 

If the sequence names are annotated with read abundance, i e the number of reads that each sequence represents, the LCAClassifier will report both the weighted read abundance and number of unique sequences (i.e. richness) for each taxon a nd also calculate a Chao-estimate of minimum richness for each taxon. This annotation is produced automatically by de-noising the data with [http://code.google.com/p/ampliconnoise Ampliconnoise] and follows a simple format; the name for each sequence in the FASTA header ends with `_N`, where ''N'' represents the number of reads. Alternative accepted formats are `weight=N` or `reads=N`.

== Aligning sequences using Megablast ==

First download and unpack the NCBI blastall suite from [ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/release/LATEST/] and place the binary for Megablast (and the other programs) are in your PATH. Then use Megablast to align your environmental SSU rRNA sequences to the Silvamod or Greengenes reference databases that are installed automatically with the LCAClassifier. Other marker genes can also be used, but require that the construction of a custom database (see below). 

Three reference databases: Silvamod, Greengenes and UNITE, are installed in the directory where 
LCAClassifier was installed, under `parts/flatdb`. The first two are for SSU rRNA and the later for ITS (fungi only) 

=== Example ===

To align the sequences of fasta file `dataset1.fa` to the Silvamod database, providing LCAClassifier was installed in the home directory, use:

 `megablast -i dataset1.fa -d ~/LCAClassifier/parts/flatdb/silvamod/silvamod.fasta -b100 -v100 -m7 -o dataset1_silvamod.xml`

Alignments will be written to the file dataset1_silvamod.xml. 

== Classification ==

The executable for the LCAClassifier is called `classify` and uses a very simple command line interface:

 `classify [options] alignment-file(s).xml`

To classify the alignment file `dataset1_silvamod.xml` using default parameters, simply use:

 `classify dataset1_silvamod.xml`

Silvamod is the default reference database. In case greengenes was used instead, the `-d` option must be used to specify the database name:

 `classify -d greengenes dataset1_greengenes.xml`

Classification can be carried out for one Megablast alignment XML file at a time, or simultaneously for several files. The advantage of the later option is that rows will always be inserted in the composition output files for all taxa that are present in at least one of the datasets, even if they are not present in all. For example, to classify `dataset1_silvamod.xml` and `dataset2_silvamod.xml` simultaneously, use:

 `classify dataset1_silvamod.xml dataset2_silvamod.xml`

=== Output ===

The LCAClassifier produces at least two output files for each sequence dataset classified. Output files are named like the XML-format alignment files from which they were derived. For example, for an alignment file named `Dataset.xml`, LCAClassifier will write the following files:

'''`Dataset_Composition.txt`'''[[BR]]
Written by default, this file contains the taxonomical composition of the dataset in tab-separated text format, designed for reading in a spreadsheet editor like Open Office (or Excel). Composition is given separately for each rank from domain to species, starting with a meta-level giving the total number of reads, classified and unclassfied reads. For each taxon, the total number of reads, its relative abundance, number of unique sequences and a chao estimate of total unique sequences is given. For each rank, the total number of reads assigned to that rank or better is also given.

'''`Dataset_Tree.txt`'''[[BR]]
Written by default, this file shows the taxonomical composition in a simple space-indented tree (in plaintext format), each taxon annotated with the number of reads.

'''`Dataset_Assignments.fasta`'''[[BR]]
Written by using option `-a`, this file gives all taxonomically annotated sequences in FASTA format. In the FASTA header, the original sequence name is first given, then the predicted taxonomic assignment from the root of the taxonomic tree to the best rank at which classification was possible (separated by semicolons). If the Minimum similarity filter prevented assignment at a higher level for this sequence, indicating it to represent a novel taxa, the last taxon is prefixed with the word "Unknown".

'''`Dataset_Assignments.txt`'''[[BR]]
Written by using option `-p`, this file lists all sequence names and their assignments in a simpe semicolon-separated format. If the Minimum similarity filter prevented assignment at a higher level for this sequence, indicating it to represent a novel taxa, the last taxon is prefixed with the word "Unknown".

'''`All_Assignments.txt`'''[[BR]]
Written by using option `-o`, this file summarises assignments for all datasets in a tab-separated format. In addition to total abundance (sum of assignments to the taxon and its child nodes) it also lists specific assignments. For each taxon, the full taxonomic path from root to the taxon itself is also given. This file is more suitable for parsing with custom scripts than  `Dataset_Composition.txt`.


'''[http://services.cbu.uib.no/supplementary/crest/LCAClassifier_Example_Output.zip Download example output files]'''

=== Other options ===

'''-h:''' shows a help message listing all options

'''-r:''' LCA bitscore range in percent (given as an integer >0; default = 2)

'''-s:''' Minimum bit-score for classification (integer >0; default = 155)

'''-n:''' Normalise relative abundances to classified sequences only (ignoring unclassified)

'''-f:''' De-activate the minimum similarity filter

'''-u:''' Include the "unknown" taxa re-classified by the minimum similarity filter also in the output of _Composition.txt

'''-i fasta-file:''' By default sequences in the taxonomically annotatated FASTA-output (_Assignments.fasta) are taken directly from the alignment XML file. This means that un-aligned sequence stretches or completely un-aligned sequences are ignored. This option instead uses the sequences from the supplied FASTA-file

'''-q qual-file:''' This option works like -i, but instead accepts a file with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phred_quality_score Phred quality scores] in fasta.qual format and outputs an annotated .qual file.

'''-v:''' Use Verbose mode. Outputs information about interesting
                        assignments to standard out.

'''-c:''' Selects which configuration file to use (by default, the file `parts/etc/lcaclassifier.conf` in the LCAClassifier's installation directory is used)


== Constructing a custom reference database ==

Starting from a reference alignment of a phylogenetic marker gene annotated with taxonomical information, the script '''`nds2CREST.py`'''can create a custom reference database for use with the LCAClassifier. We recommend using the program [http://www.arb-home.de ARB] to create and annotate such an alignment from a set of sequences.

nds2CREST.py requires three different input files: 

1. Sequences of the reference marker genes in the alignment, in FASTA format ('''`sequences.fasta`''' in the example below). It is important that the sequences are cropped so that stretches of unaligned sequence is not included. Such sequences may bias the alignments during classification. In ARB, this can be done by using a positional filter when exporting sequences.

2. A tab-separated text file (in ARB language "NDS file") containing the taxonomic annotations of each aligned sequence ('''`taxa.nds`''' in the example below). This file must contain two or three columns separated by tabs. The first column is the accession number corresponding to the sequence file. The second contains the taxonomic structure with ranks separated by slash, semicolon or underscores (e.g. Domain;Phylum;Class). The third column (optional) contains the species or strain name or a unique description of the sequence. This file can be exported from ARB by first setting up NDS display correctly in the menu `Tree > NDS (Node Display Setup)`. For SILVA, check the leaf box  for "acc", then for group for "tax_slv" and for leaf for "full name". Then write the file using `File > Export > Export fields using NDS`. '''Example: '''`A16379	Bacteria/Proteobacteria/Gammaproteobacteria_1/Pasteurellales_Pasteurellaceae/Haemophilus	Haemophilus ducreyi`


3. A tab-separated text file containing the changes to be made to the taxonomic structure ('''`MCF.txt`''' in the example below). These changes can also be used as a proof-reading; in case they were already carried out, the script simply confirms them and if not they are carried out. To discard this option, use an empty "manual changes file" (MCF). [http://services.cbu.uib.no/supplementary/crest/ManualChanges_example.csv Download an example describing the file format of the MCF]

The script nds2CREST is then run using (replace "$LCADir" with the installation direcrory of the LCAClassifier):

 `$LCADir/bin/python $LCADir/src/LCAClassifier/nds2CREST.py database-name sequences.fasta MCF.txt taxa.nds`

This may result in a list of warnings being written to standard.error if for example a sequence included sequences.fasta was not in the taxa.nds file or vice versa, or if duplicate names of taxa appeared in different topological context. In the former case, the sequence will be ignored. In the later, a parent suffix will be added to the sequence, for example "Cryptococcus", which is the name of an insect genus as well as a fungal one, will become "Cryptococcus (Eriococcidae)". The same happens if the same name is used for two different ranks, e.g. "Bacteria;Actinobacteria;Actinobacteria" will become "Bacteria;Actinobacteria (phylum);Actinobacteria (class)".

After successful completion, nds2CREST will create three new files:

 '''database-name.tre:''' the taxonomy of the reference database in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newick_format Newick format], each taxon represented by a unique numeral identifier

 '''database-name.map:'''  a mapping file, mapping the taxa identifiers to their full names and taxonomic rank

 '''database-name.fasta:''' the reference database in FASTA-format (simply the same as `sequences.fasta` but with un-mapped sequences removed).

These files are needed by the LCAClassifier in order to make taxonomic assignments and the .tre and .map files for Silvamod can be found in ~/LCAClassifier/LCADir/parts/flatdb/silvamod/silvamod.map or silvamod.tre if LCAClassifier was installed in the $HOME directory (~). To add your own custom database with the somewhat unimaginative name "database-name" as used in the examples above, create a new directory named "database-name" under the directory `flatdb` and copy these two files there:

 `mkdir ~/LCAClassifier/LCADir/parts/flatdb/database-name`
 
 `cp database-name.* ~/LCAClassifier/LCADir/parts/flatdb/database-name`

You also need to format the FASTA-file for Megablast (or BLAST) using the command `formatdb` (installed with the blastall suite):

 `cd ~/LCAClassifier/LCADir/parts/flatdb/database-name`

 `formatdb -i database-name.fasta -pF`

The final change you need to do before using your own reference database is to tell the configuration file of the LCAClassifier where to find it. Edit the file `~/LCAClassifier/parts/etc/lcaclassifier.conf` and add a new line. For example:

 `database-name = /Home/user/LCAClassifier/parts/flatdb/database-name`

* Note that this will be overwritten if you update the LCAClassifier or re-build it. To make the change permanent, also add it in the file `~/LCAClassifier/etc/lcaclassifier.conf.in`

* As you notice, you can keep your reference database anywhere you want in the file system, not necessarily in the LCAClassifier installation directory, as long as you make the correct changes in lcaclassifier.conf

To use your new reference database:

 `megablast -i env.fa -d ~/LCAClassifier/parts/flatdb/database-name/database-name.fasta -b100 -v100 -m7 -o env_custom.xml`

 `classifiy -d database-name env_custom.xml`
